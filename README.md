# Arduino-Projects

This repository contains Arduino-based projects separated into UI and logic components.

## 🛠️ How to Run Each Program

- Use the `.json` file to load the virtual components (UI setup).
- Use the `.ino` file for the logic part (code).

## ▶️ Run Virtually

To simulate the project online, visit:  
👉 [https://wokwi.com/](https://wokwi.com/)

You can upload both the `.json` and `.ino` files there to test your circuit virtually.

## 🚀 Run on Real Arduino

To implement the project on real hardware:
- Install the **Arduino IDE**: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Open the `.ino` file in the IDE and upload it to your Arduino board.
