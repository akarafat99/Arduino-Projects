# Arduino-Projects

This repository is a project hub containing beginner-friendly, Arduino-based hardware projects that demonstrate essential microcontroller concepts. The projects are organized with a clear separation between UI (virtual circuit layout) and logic (code), and utilize components like push buttons, IR motion sensors, LEDs, and seven-segment displays for real-time interaction and feedback.

## 💻 How to Run Each Project

### ▶️ Run Virtually
You can simulate these projects online using Wokwi:

👉 [https://wokwi.com/](https://wokwi.com/)

- Upload the `.json` file for the virtual circuit layout.
- Upload the corresponding `.ino` file for the logic.

### 🚀 Run on Real Arduino
To implement the project on physical hardware:

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Open the `.ino` file
3. Connect the hardware as per circuit comments or guide
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board
